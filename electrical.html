                                  A diploma in Electrical Engineering, a 3-year course is an art to create a developed world around us. All our day-day activities are dependent on electrical energy which is being produced or generated by an electrical engineer. The diploma in Electrical Engineering program of SVSD is designed with an endeavor to create globally competitive and employable engineers. A diploma in Electrical Engineering is related to Electric Circuits, Instrumentation, Machine Drives, Machine Design, Power Electronics, and Power & Energy Systems. The major sub-disciplines of the course include many additional departmental-level programs like case studies, innovative mini-projects, covering subject gaps, student seminars, group discussions, and Technical quizzes. The seminars /webinars are organized where students can discuss with industrial or research experts about the practical implementation and current issues of their subject topics. The major subjects of the EE program cover ever-challenging In this program students also enjoy the flavor of electronics and computer science as an application area of electrical engineering. After completion, the student can shift into any sub-disciplinary area like Micro Electrical Engineering, Power Engineering, Instrumentation Engineering, Telecommunication Engineering, and Electrical Design Engineering.
                                  The program offers the students a conducive and rewarding environment by contributing to seminars, live projects, and case studies to pursue ideas, cultivate the spirit of curiosity and sustain the passion for excellence. The perfect blend of Industry-Academia environment develops students with practical hands-on sessions offering a dynamic teaching program for creating a vibrant and successful community of professionals who can develop both concepts and skills essential for drawing, designing, analysis, construction, and maintenance of various kinds of Electrical Engineering projects.

                              By employing microprocessor solutions, students can lower capital cost of the system, and system maintenance costs. This improves time to market and the quality of products. Depending on the particular application, the hardware available include digital input and output, counters, timers, interrupts, capabilities. During the study students become familiar to hardware and software of microprocessor.

The idea workshop was to equip students with the various components and their workings that they would be coming across in the next few years. Mr. Soumya kanti Datta and  Mr. Kailash Bauri had shown different electrical components such as resistor, capacitor, inductor, battery etc and electronic components such as diode, LED, transistors and soldering machines. Different types of circuits and electrical joints were introduced and the necessary apparatus to form the circuit were provided to them.Students were enlightened with the knowledge of microcontroller based electronic circuit i.e Arduino Uno. Mr Arjun Ray had given a brief introduction on Arduino Uno and shown the students the how the microcontroller work by the help programing. 

                                  More than 80 students and all the faculty members of the Electrical Engineering Department had participated in this workshop. The program was inaugurated by honorable Principal sir Mr. Suman Pramanik of " Swami Vivekananda School of Diploma "   and honorable Registrar sir Dr. Snigdhadip Ghosh of " Swami Vivekananda School of Diploma " .

The idea workshop was to equip students with the various components and their workings that they would be coming across in the next few years. Mr. Soumya kanti Datta and  Mr. Kailash Bauri had shown different electrical components such as resistor, capacitor, inductor, battery etc and electronic components such as diode, LED, transistors and soldering machines. Different types of circuits and electrical joints were introduced and the necessary apparatus to form the circuit were provided to them.Students were enlightened with the knowledge of microcontroller based electronic circuit i.e Arduino Uno. Mr Arjun Ray had given a brief introduction on Arduino Uno and shown the students the how the microcontroller work by the help programing. 

                              More than 80 students and all the faculty members of the Electrical Engineering Department had participated in this workshop. The program was inaugurated by honorable Principal sir Mr. Suman Pramanik of " Swami Vivekananda School of Diploma "   and honorable Registrar sir Dr. Snigdhadip Ghosh of " Swami Vivekananda School of Diploma " .
